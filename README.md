D2Ex2
=====

A Diablo II 1.11b improvement mod. Been used on realm.angrenost.org.

Features
--------

- Completely reworked party screen, can handle up to 64 players
- Fixed some vanilla bugs, random crashes etc
- Expanded Sounds.Txt limit to 4954, you can easily increase to more (D2Ex2.cpp's patches)
- Reduced TCP/IP / Open BNet join time.
- Lagometer (ported from Q3 source :D)
- Reworked ESC-menu, get rid of .dc6 files. Now creating your own menu is easy as pie (ExOptions.cpp)
- Created a lot of custom controls, you can use them to create your GUI (ie new party screen)
